why dehaze?

1. increase visibility of scene
2. most computer vision algorithms assume that all input of images is the scene irradiance 
3. removal can provide depth information

**haze or fog can be a useful depth clur for scene understanding**

it's like bad hazy image can be put to good use.

challenge: unknown depth;

method: 

1. multiple imges(diffent weather conditions not work)
2. maximize the local contrast(but cannot handle the heavy hazy image)
